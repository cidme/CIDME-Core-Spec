CIDME Core Specification

**_NOTE:_** The CIDME Core specification is currently under active internal development and is not currently ready for release.  However, the the alpha-level vocabulary can be found in the [_gh-pages_ branch of the CIDME/CIDME project](https://github.com/cidme/CIDME/tree/gh-pages).  HTML and JSON files may also be somewhat-navigated by browsing the [CIDME.net website](http://cidme.net).
